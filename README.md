# RedC2

Welcome to C2 Development in C# (https://courses.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/c2-development-in-csharp)

This course will demonstrate how to build a basic Command & Control Framework in C#. You will create a RESTful API-driven Team Server written in ASP.NET Core, an implant targeting the .NET Framework, and Unit Test projects to validate intended functionality.

By the end of the course, you will have an implant capable of communicating with the Team Server over HTTP, receive tasks and send the results back. Many aspects of the code shown can be improved and expanded on. It's my hope that students will continue to develop their code beyond what is explicitly demonstrated, adding their own twists and features; or to build their own frameworks from scratch in languages of their choice using the concepts taught.
